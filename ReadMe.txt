Sun & Moon Navigator
====================

Find north using the time and the sun or moon. Simply point the top of your device at the sun or moon, select your hemisphere (northern or southern) and the arrow will point north. Just make sure the time and date on your device is accurate for your location.

Disclaimer
This app should not be relied upon for navigation, for the obvious reason that without the sun or moon being visible, it doesn’t work. The accuracy degrades as you move closer to the equator. It is for indication only!
